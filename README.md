# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ Challenges on Frontend Mentor

Frontend Mentor challenges help me to improve my coding skills by building realistic projects, that take my coding skills to the next level.

## [01. QR Code Component](https://github.com/kanishkasubash/frontend-mentor-challenges/tree/main/qr-code-component)

This is my first project in Frontend Mentor challenges. A perfect biginner challenge with HTML and CSS. The card layout doesn't shift, so it's ideal to learn about building responsive layouts.

## [02. Social Media Dashboard with Theme Switcher](https://github.com/kanishkasubash/frontend-mentor-challenges/tree/main/social-media-dashboard)

My challenge is to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To do this challenge, I need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript.
