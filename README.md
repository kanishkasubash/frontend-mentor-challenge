# Challenges on Frontend Mentor

Frontend Mentor challenges help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects, that take my coding skills to the next level.

## [01. QR Code Component](https://github.com/kanishkasubash/frontend-mentor-challenges/tree/main/qr-code-component)

This is my first project in Frontend Mentor challenges. A perfect biginner challenge with HTML and CSS. The card layout doesn't shift, so it's ideal to learn about building responsive layouts.
