**Hi! 👋, Frontend Friends.**

I've just completed a front-end coding challenge. This is my solution for the **Social Media Dashboard with Theme Switcher**.

**🛠️ Built With:**
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS/SCSS
- Node.JS
- GULP.JS
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile First Approach

**📦Features:**
- The user indicates their preference through an operating system setting (e.g. light or dark mode) or a user agent setting.
- Responsiveness (Mobile/Tab/Laptop/Desktop).
- Toggle button for custom Theme Change.
- Hover Effects
- Animations

**🔖What I am learned:**
- Level Up SCSS & JS
- Toggling Button
- `prefers-color-scheme`. [Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme)
- Window: localStorage property. [Link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
- CSS **Flexbox** & **Grid**. [Link](https://blog.logrocket.com/css-flexbox-vs-css-grid/#css-grid-layout-flexbox-alignment)

**💡Any suggestions on how I can improve are welcome!**

😊I'll be happy to hear any feedback and advice! Thank you.
